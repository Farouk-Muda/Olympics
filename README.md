# Olympics
A proof of my SQL skills to analyse the datasets.

## Background
This is a real datasets detailing the 120 years of Olympics History dataset from Kaggle from the user [rgriffin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) that will help us to appreciate the insights we gleaned from the data. 
This dataset contains two files: 
- athlete_events.csv, which contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events) and 
- noc_regions.csv also contains 230 rows and 3 columns (National Olympic Committee, NOC ;country name and notes).

Techtfq has tremendous interest in SQL and formulated 20 queries which will be used and answered in this project.
